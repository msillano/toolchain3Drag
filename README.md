# toolchain3Drag
Using regexfilter, I make this toolchain for G-code, to simplify the text engraving using 3D printers.


The java program, regexfilter, carries out multiple substitutions in a text using the "regular expressions", a way much
more powerful than the simple search/replace.
Here it is specilized to modify G-code, and it is integrated on Notepad++, for more easy usage.
